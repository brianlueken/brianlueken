- 🔭 I’m currently working on DevOps Tool selection for Salesforce between Gearset and Copado (1 demo down and 1 demo scheduled)
- ⌛ I’m currently scheduled to test on Salesforce AI tools and happy I waited because this <https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/aispecialist> just became a free certification (re: <https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/09/18/ai-training-opportunities/>)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/> with 5 modules left covering the following:
  - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/design-data-storage-solutions/>
